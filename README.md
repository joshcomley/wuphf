# Title: WUPHF

# Project: 
Server Tool

# Technologies: 
* .NET Core Web API for backend REST API
* SQL Server for Database
* MAUI .NET front end (multi platform)

# Description: 
A tool to make taking a server simpler and easier. Currently we use a teams channel to say "Taking Syrio" and "Done" when we're done to say we're logging on to a server and to say we're done using it. We sometimes forget to type done. We sometimes forget to say we're taking it. This tool will make that process easier and also show us easily who has which server and reduce the need for us to scroll up and check. It will even remind us to release the server. It's multi platform, so can work on Windows, Android phone, iOS device and Mac OS.

# Roadmap: 
1. Notifications to release the server
2. Nudge person who has server
3. User authentication and login to use app.

# Run:
1. Run backend solution wuphf\BackEnd\Wuphf.Backend.sln
2. Run frontend solution (need VS2022) wuphf\FrontEnd\Wuphf.sln
